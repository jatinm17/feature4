      "1. Create a new binary column called \"Male\" and initialize it with zeros.\n",
      "2. Create another binary column called \"Female\" and also initialize it with zeros.\n",
      "3. For each data point (row), if the \"gender\" is \"Male,\" set the value in the \"Male\" column to 1. If the \"gender\" is \"Female,\" set the value in the \"Female\" column to 1.\n",
      "\n",
      "Example:\n",
      "Suppose you have the following data for the \"gender\" feature:\n",

      "- Row 2: Female\n",
